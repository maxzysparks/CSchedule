Social Media Scheduler



Social Media Scheduler
This Python class allows you to schedule social media posts and publish them at a specified time. It has the following features:

Schedule posts for multiple platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram)
View the list of scheduled posts for all platforms or for a specific platform
Publish the next post to be published
Usage
To use the SocialMediaScheduler class, first import it:

from social_media_scheduler import SocialMediaScheduler
Then, create an instance of the class:


scheduler = SocialMediaScheduler()
You can then use the following methods to schedule and publish posts:

schedule_post(platform, message, time)
This method schedules a post for the specified platform (e.g., 'Twitter', 'Facebook', 'Instagram') with the given message and time. The time should be a string in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.


scheduler.schedule_post('Twitter', 'Hello, world!', '2022-01-01 12:00:00')
get_scheduled_posts()
This method returns a list of all scheduled posts. Each post is represented as a dictionary with the following keys:

platform: the platform for the post (e.g., 'Twitter', 'Facebook', 'Instagram')
message: the message for the post
time: the scheduled time for the post, as a datetime object

scheduled_posts = scheduler.get_scheduled_posts()
print(scheduled_posts)
get_scheduled_posts_for_platform(platform)
This method returns a list of scheduled posts for the specified platform.


twitter_posts = scheduler.get_scheduled_posts_for_platform('Twitter')
print(twitter_posts)
get_next_post()
This method returns the next post to be published. It does this by sorting the list of scheduled posts by time and returning the first post in the sorted list.


next_post = scheduler.get_next_post()
print(next_post)
publish_next_post()
This method publishes the next post by printing it to the console and then removing it from the list of scheduled posts.


scheduler.publish_next_post()
Example
Here is an example of how to use the SocialMediaScheduler class to schedule and publish some posts:


from social_media_scheduler import SocialMediaScheduler

# Create a scheduler
scheduler = SocialMediaScheduler()

# Schedule some posts
scheduler.schedule_post('Twitter', 'Hello, world!', '2022-01-01 12:00:00')
scheduler.schedule_post('Facebook', 'Hello, world!', '2022-01-01
