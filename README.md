# Content-scheduler-for-social-media-platforms

To use this class, you would first create an instance of the SocialMediaScheduler class:



scheduler = SocialMediaScheduler()

Then you can schedule posts using the schedule_post() method, passing in the platform (e.g. "Twitter", "Facebook", etc.), the message to post, and the time to post it at:


scheduler.schedule_post('Twitter', 'Hello, world!', '2022-12-08 12:00:00')

You can use the get_scheduled_posts() method to get a list of all the scheduled posts:


scheduled_posts = scheduler.get_scheduled_posts()

Or you can use the get_scheduled_posts_for_platform() method to get a list of only the posts scheduled for a specific platform:


twitter_posts = scheduler.get_scheduled_posts_for_platform('Twitter')

When it's time to publish a post, you can use the publish_next_post() method to publish the next post that is scheduled to be published:
